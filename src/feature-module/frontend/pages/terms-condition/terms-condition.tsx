                    payments to Service Professionals for the services they
                    render to you and collects payments on behalf of such

                    the ability to bind or represent Dpcon. c) The Platform is
                    for your personal and non-commercial (on Dpcon website we

                    services?) use only, unless otherwise agreed upon on in
                    accordance with the terms of a separate agreement. Please
                    note that the Platform is intended for use only within

                    utilisation of the Services, or as a part of its promotional

                    right to charge you for the different Services you may avail
                    and/or for any other facilities you may opt for, from time
                    to time, on or via the Platform. b) Charges and Fees in
                    respect of Pro Services: i. In respect of Pro Services that
                    you seek to avail through the Platform, you shall be
                    required to pay Service Professionals the amount indicated
                    at the time of booking as well as amounts towards (a) any
                    additional Pro Services you may avail, (b) out of pocket
                    expenses incurred by the Service Professional, and (c)
                    expenses arising out of the purchase of goods required or
                    utilised for the performance of the Pro Service (“Charges”).
                    In addition to the Charges payable to Service Professionals,
                    Dpcon reserves the right to charge you a convenience fee for
                    facilitating the booking and transferring payments to the
                    Service Professional (this fee is referred to as “Fees”).
                    You acknowledge that the final bill you receive may include
                    additional charges, including without limitation, a safety
                    fee, warranty fee, insurance fee, or Service Professional
                    welfare fee. ii. Dpcon shall notify you of the applicable
                    Charges, Fees, and payment methods at the time of booking.
                    Generally, you may make payments for Pro Services through
                    credit cards, debit cards, net banking, wallets, UPI or cash
                    upon completion of the Pro Service. Payment terms, methods,
                    and fees will be specified at the point of transaction. We
                    have the right to modify and otherwise restrict the modes of
                    payment available to you. You acknowledge that certain
                    payment methods such as cash upon completion may not always
                    be available to you as a payment method. For the avoidance
                    of doubt, in the event you pay through the method of ‘cash
                    upon completion’, you acknowledge that you will be required
                    to pay both Charges and Fees to the Service Professional.
                    Late payments may incur additional charges as outlined in
                    the payment policy. iii. The Charges and Fees may be payable
                    at the time of making a booking, or upon the completion of
                    the Pro Service, as specified by Dpcon. iv. For the
                    avoidance of doubt, please note that the Charges are payable
                    to Service Professionals, and Dpcon acts as a limited
                    collection agent on behalf of such Service Professionals to
                    collect and transfer amounts due to them. v. Taxes: All
                    Charges and Fees are inclusive of applicable taxes. vi.
                    Dpcon reserves the right to reasonably amend the Charges and
                    Fees at any time at its sole discretion. A change in Fees
                    shall not impact any bookings that have been confirmed
                    before the publication of the revised Fees on the Platform.
                    vii. Charges and Fees that you pay are final and
                    non-refundable, unless otherwise determined by Dpcon or
                    required by the applicable laws. Under certain laws, you may
                    be entitled to a refund or other remedies for a failure in
                    the provision of the Services. viii. A refund will be issued
                    to the original payment method within seven to ten business
                    days if the refund is eligible. Refunds may be subject to
                    deductions for any non-recoverable costs incurred. ix. You
                    acknowledge and agree that Charges and Fees applicable in
                    certain geographical areas may increase substantially during
                    times of high demand. Dpcon will use reasonable efforts to
                    inform you of the Charges and Fees that may apply. However,
                    by using the Pro Services or Services, you will be
                    responsible for the Charges and Fees incurred under your
                    Account regardless of your awareness of such Charges or
                    Fees. c) Payment Processors: We may use a third-party
                    payment processor (“Payment Processor”) to bill you through
                    your selected mode of payment. The processing of payments
                    will be subject to the terms and policies of such Payment
                    Processor in addition to these Terms. We shall not be liable
                    for any error of the Payment Processor. In the event of any
                    unsuccessful payment, the money debited shall be credited in
                    accordance with the terms of the Payment Processor. d)

                    with these Terms; (vii) decompile, reverse engineer, or
                    disassemble the Services; (viii) link to, mirror, or frame,
                    any portion of all or any of the Services; or (ix) violate
                    applicable laws in any manner. e) You warrant that you shall
                    not engage in any activity that interferes with or disrupts
                    the Services. f) You shall not attempt to gain unauthorised
                    access to any portion or feature of the Services, any other
                    systems or networks connected to the Services, to any of our
                    servers, or through the Platform by hacking, password
                    mining, or any other illegitimate means. g) You shall not
                    directly or indirectly, in any capacity, solicit, attempt to
                    influence, engage, approach, or accept or encourage the
                    solicitations or approach of, a Service Professional from
                    whom you have availed Pro Services, to either terminate or
                    otherwise cease their registration on or engagement with the
                    Platform, or avail services the same as or similar to the
                    Pro Services independently, without booking the Pro Services
                    through your Account. You agree that this limitation is
                    reasonable and fair and is necessary for the protection of
                    the privacy and security of Service Professionals and that
                    this will not preclude you from obtaining services the same
                    as or similar to the Pro Services through the Platform or
                    other means. You further agree that any potential harm to
                    Service Professionals from the non-enforcement of this
                    clause far outweighs any potential harm to you.

                    12. DISCLAIMERS AND WARRANTIES (a) The Services are provided
                    on an “as is” basis without warranty of any kind, express,
                    implied, statutory or otherwise, including without
                    limitation the implied warranties of title,
                    non-infringement, merchantability, or fitness for a
                    particular purpose. Without limiting the foregoing, we make
                    no warranty that the Services will meet your requirements or
                    expectations. (b) No advice or information, whether oral or
                    written, obtained by you from us shall create any warranty
                    that is not expressly stated in the Terms. (c) While Dpcon
                    strives to provide accurate information about Pro Services
                    and Charges, pricing errors may occur from time to time. (d)
                    You agree and acknowledge that we are merely a Platform that
                    connects you with Service Professionals, and we shall not be
                    liable in any manner for any obligations that have not been
                    explicitly stated in these Terms. We are not liable or
                    responsible for fulfilment of any bookings, for the
                    performance of the Pro Services by any Service Professional,
                    or for any acts or omissions of the Service Professionals
                    during their provision of the Pro Services including any
                    damage they may cause to property. By booking Pro Services
                    through the Platform, you are entering into a contract with
                    the relevant Service Provider for the provision of those
                    services, and we accept no responsibility or liability, nor
                    do we make any warranty, representation, or guarantee in
                    respect of the Service Professional’s performance under that
                    contract. (e) You agree and acknowledge that soliciting or
                    receiving services from any Service Professional
                    independently is solely at your own risk, and in such an
                    event, you waive any rights that you may have under these
                    Terms. (f) We do not guarantee or warrant and we make no
                    representation whatsoever regarding the reliability,
                    quality, or suitability of the Service Professionals. (g)
                    You hereby accept full responsibility for any consequences
                    that may arise from your use of the Services and Pro
                    Services, and expressly agree and acknowledge that we shall
                    have absolutely no liability in this regard. (h) Dpcon will
                    maintain a complaints management framework and will manage
                    this framework on behalf of Service Professionals in a
                    reasonable manner and in accordance with the non-excludable
                    requirements of relevant applicable laws. (i) To the fullest
                    extent permissible by law, we, our affiliates, and our
                    related parties, each disclaim all liability for any loss or
                    damage arising out of, or due to: (i) your use of, inability
                    to use, or availability or unavailability of the Services or
                    the Pro Services; (ii) the occurrence or existence of any
                    defect, interruption, or delays, in the operation or
                    transmission of information to, from, or through the
                    Services, communications failure, theft, destruction, or
                    unauthorised access to our records, programmes, services,
                    servers, or other infrastructure relating to the Services;
                    (iii) the failure of the Services to remain operational for
                    any period of time; and (iv) the loss of any User Content
                    and any other data in connection with your use of the
                    Services. (j) In no event shall Dpcon, its officers,
                    directors, and employees, or its contractors, agents,
                    licensors, partners, or suppliers, be liable to you for any
                    direct, special, indirect, incidental, consequential,
                    punitive, reliance, or exemplary damages (including without
                    limitation, lost business opportunities, lost revenues, or
                    loss of anticipated profits or any other pecuniary or
                    non-pecuniary loss or damage of any nature whatsoever,
                    including but not limited to any abuse or breach of data),
                    even if Dpcon or an authorised representative had been
                    advised of the possibility of such damages, arising out of,
                    or relating to (A) these Terms, (B) the Services or the Pro
                    Services, (C) your use or inability to use the Services or
                    the Pro Services, or (D) any other interactions with another
                    user of the Services. (k) To the maximum extent permitted by
                    law, our liability shall be limited to the amount of
                    commission we receive in respect of a particular booking
                    made on the Platform. In no event shall our total liability
                    to you in connection with these Terms exceed INR 10,000
                    (Rupees Ten Thousand). (l) Nothing in these Terms will
                    exclude or limit any warranty implied by law that it would
                    be unlawful to exclude or limit.

                    accordance with the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996
                    for the time being in force, which is deemed to be

                    16. MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS (a) Changes to Terms: The Terms
                    are subject to revisions at any time, as determined by us,
                    and all changes are effective immediately upon being posted
                    on the Platform. It is your responsibility to review these
                    Terms periodically for any updates or changes. You will be
                    deemed to have accepted the changes made to these Terms if
                    you continue to use the Platform once it has been posted.
                    (b) Modification to the terms: It is the Company s sole
                    discretion to update or modify these Terms and Conditions at
                    any time. All changes will become effective immediately
                    after they are posted on the web app. (c) Severability: If
                    any provision of these Terms is determined by any court or
                    other competent authority to be unlawful or unenforceable,
                    the other provisions of these Terms will continue to be in
                    effect. If any unlawful or unenforceable provision would be
                    lawful or enforceable if a part of it were deleted, that
                    part will be deemed to be deleted, and the rest of the
                    provision will continue in effect (unless that would
                    contradict the clear intention of the clause, in which case
                    the entirety of the relevant provision will be deemed to be
                    deleted). (d) Assignment: You shall not license, sell,
                    transfer, or assign your rights, obligations, or covenants
                    under these Terms, or your Account in any manner without our
                    prior written consent. We may grant or withhold this consent
                    at our sole discretion, subject to any conditions we deem
                    appropriate. We may assign our rights to any of our
                    affiliates, subsidiaries, or parent companies, any successor
                    in interest of any business associated with the Services, or
                    any third party without any prior notice to you. (e)
                    Notices: All notices, requests, demands, and determinations
                    for us under these Terms (other than routine operational
                    communications) shall be sent to (dpcons email id). (f)
